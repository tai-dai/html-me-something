                    <p>I am writing this at great risk to myself. If I am found out by the powers that be, I cannot allow my discoveries to vanish alongside me. The world must know the truth. The world must know about...</p>
                    <p class = 'floatyText2'>birds.</p>
                    <p>Ah, the bird--winged denizen of nature. Unlikely descendant of the tyrannosaurus rex. Aerial companion to humans. We've all seen birds.</p>
                    <img id = 'featheredDemons' src = './images/feathered_demons.jpg' alt = 'Government drones.'>
                    <p>Look at those fluffy, feathered nuggets of innocence. As constant as the air through which they soar, birds have always been a familiar presence. In these times of strife, there is one certainty in this world; you can always trust birds.</p>
                    <p>That's exactly what the ruling class would have you believe. Heck, that's what <em>I</em> used to believe. Until the fateful day I opened my eyes to the truth.</p>

                    <p>It was late one quarantine night I discovered the truth. As I lounged, enjoying my bi-nightly Calpijito*, I looked out my window. Perched upon my porch, doing nothing in particular, was a scissor-tailed flycatcher. I thought little of it.</p>
                    <p>Until two nights later, that is. Calpijito in hand, I passed my porch door, and there it was again. The scissor-tailed flycatcher.</p>

                    <p class = 'floatyText2'>Waiting.</p>
                    <p class = 'floatyText3'>Commiserating.**</p>
                    <p>Night after night, I would surreptitiously peek out into the black Missouri sky, and always, the scissor-tailed flycatcher would catch not a fly, but my gaze. <em>Hella sus,</em>I thought. So, phone screen obscured from any windows, I asked Earth's wisest entity for enlightenment. Google led me to this video:</p>

                    <p>As the revelation unfolded, cold sweat dotted my back as I realized the bird was documenting my shock. Except, it wasn't. The bird was gone. It knows that I know the truth, and now it has flown off to all its bird friends, and now those birds know that it knows that I know, and that aside, all I know for certain is one thing:</p>

                    <p>Yes, those very same gravitationally-flexible lil' homies I have long known and loved have been playing us all from day one. This truth had both set me free and damned me. Everywhere I go, the aviary hivemind watches me from the trees. I have made peace with my immutable fate, but I must make my discoveries known. If you are reading this, please, pass along this wisdom. And remember,</p>

                    <p>Hi, lemme step out of the bit real quick--I actually really like birds. I regularly lay out my gently-expired granola for the little buddies in the neighborhood. I've always wanted a grey parrot, but they're a lot of upkeep and responsibility and--OKAY THEY'RE NOT WATCHING SEND THIS PAGE TO EVERYONE IN YOUR CONTACTS AND THEN FEED YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH A PAPER SHREDDER SO THE BIRDS CAN'T TRACE YOU</p>
